# Tic Tac Toe with Javascript!

Objectives

Implement a fully functioning tic-tac-toe board in JavaScript and CSS that can be playable by two people at the same computer. When a winning move is played, raise an alert that displays the winning player in the modal. After clicking OK, a new game should start. When a game move is made that casts the game to a draw, raise an alert that displays "Draw", and resets the game after clicking OK. You will use CSS and JavaScript to make this happen.

Building a tic-tac-toe in CSS in JavaScript can be done in a series of steps.

- Build a tic-tac-toe board using what we've learned about the Box Model. It may be helpful to have 9 separate elements that are arranged to display the board and can be selected individually in JavaScript. As a result, these boxes should have unique values. One way to do this would be to set data-attributes
- In your javascript store a list of all the possible combinations of values that would produce a winning move. There are 8 possible winning combinations. A group across the top row, the middle row, bottom row, left column, middle column, right column, and both ways diagonally are valid winning combinations.
- When a user clicks one of the boxes on the board, it should display a large "X" inside of the box. The next time someone clicks a box, it should display a large "O" in the box.
"X"s and "O"s should continue to alternate until the end of the game is reached.
- Additionally, when a user clicks a box, it should store the clicked value in a list with previously stored values. It is likely that you will have two lists of clicked boxes, one for Player 1, and one for Player 2.
- If either list contains a winning combination of values, raise the alert with "Player 1", or "Player 2", depending on who won.
- When there are no more boxes to click, or when 9 moves have been made, raise an alert that the game was a "Draw".
- After clicking "OK" for either alert, the game should reset.

In completing this challenge, you'll be touching on a number of key HTML/CSS and JavaScript fundamentals. As you move through the program, you should be able to identify which part of the critical path you are currently on:

- CSS Box Model
- CSS Floats/Grids
- JavaScript Click Events
- Javascript Arrays
- Javascript Conditional Statements
